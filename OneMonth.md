Dad's should spend as much time as possible with Mom and new baby in hospital. The nurses are happy to teach and a full of knowledge about the newborns! (it's like their job or something)

Baby stays with Mom unless Mom *really* needs to sleep/rest. The only other time they'll take baby away is for their first bath and some tests.
